Each Lab is in a seperate folder. Here some additional explanations are provided to help you better understand the structure of the files and codes.


## LAB1:
Q1 folder is the `Hello World` program. 

Q2 folder is `getting input from stdin` program.

And finally, Q3 is `mathematical computations` program. Plus, we have done the extra part!

- If first operand is divided by zero, you will be shown "Infinity" but the program still works!

- `Prime Command` will print every single Prime number lower than the given number, regardless whether it is Prime or not.

## LAB2:
This folder contains two sub folder namely `App` and `jaba2`. The `App` folder is my (Nima Samadi) implementation of this labarotary. It contains both mandatory and extra parts of this lap. 

`jaba2` folder is Milad Saadat's implementations of the lab. It also contains extra parts of the lab along with the mandatory ones.

The codes are pretty self-explanatory and easy to understand :)

## LAB3:
All classes are in the `src` folder and executable files are in `out` folder. To test the performance of the code, we have used the following tree:

The code is figuring out if there is a path between node 0 and 3 or vice versa.
